Datapunt: Authentication & Authorization service
================================================

Congratulations, you found the documentation for the authentication and
authorization (AA) service at the heart of the city of Amsterdam's `open data
services <https://api.datapunt.amsterdam.nl/api/>`_.

The AA service authenticates users through external identity providers (IdP's)
and creates refresh and access tokens in the form of
`JSON Web Tokens <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519>`_ (JWTs).
